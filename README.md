It's Twitterversary blocks, but with screens and internet. Originally a Fall 2019 Twitter HackWeek project by [@johnboiles](github.com/johnboiles), [@magus](github.com/magus), [@mikeperiscope](github.com/mikeperiscope), [@seanfchan](github.com/seanfchan), and [@smartfuse](github.com/smartfuse).

## Components

### PCB

This contains the [Autodesk Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) design files for the 3 PCBs that make up the block. See the [README.md](https://github.com/bountylabs/blocks-with-screens/blob/main/pcb/README.md) in that directory for an overview of the responsibilities of the three different boards.

### Blockware

This is the example software that you can run on the blocks. See the [README.md](https://github.com/bountylabs/blocks-with-screens/blob/main/blockware/README.md) in that directory for a listing of the example projects.

### VirtualBlox

An experimental block simulator from [@mikeperiscope](github.com/mikeperiscope). You can compile blockware along with VirtualBlox and run block software locally for testing! This gives a much quicker development iteration cycle than uploading to the block itself.
