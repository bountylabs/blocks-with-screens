An example of downloading a binary 565 image and rendering it onto the OLED display. Also includes example code for using Arduino OTA for wireless programming.

## Getting set up for development

1. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Install the [PlatformIO IDE](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html) plugin for VSCode
1. If programming over USB/serial, change the `upload_port` line in the `platformio.ini` file to match your local serial port (something like `/dev/cu.wchusbserial123`)
