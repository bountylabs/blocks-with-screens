# Stocks and Weather Server

This is a simple server that takes some complex APIs on the internet, and simplifies them to a response that should be of a much more manageable size to process on the block.

TODO: It'd be great to see if we can figure out how to get the API access working directly on the block as it'd simplify this quite a bit. It should be possible, but it might take some trickery in only looking at the relevant bits in the HTTP response. Worst case we could probably implement a parser that streams through the HTTP response and only reads the fields we're interested in.

TODO: This is in @seanfchan's and/or @magus's brain(s).
