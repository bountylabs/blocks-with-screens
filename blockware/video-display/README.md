# Video Display

This is an advanced example of streaming uncompressed video over UDP to the block. It consists of a client program running on a computer that sends the video and a server program running on the block that displays the video on its screen.

# Running the server on the block

Build the code for the block as you would any of these other programs. Make sure to create a `src/secrets.h` based on the `src/secrets.h.example` and edit to include your WiFi credentials.

## Running the client code
