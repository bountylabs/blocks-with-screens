# JPEG Download Example

A small example of downloading a JPEG and rendering it onto the OLED display.

Warning: These OLED displays can experience burn-in. If you leave your block on nonstop with the same image, the ghost of that image may be visible when you do solid colors on the screen later.

## Configuring

Create a `secrets.h` file based on `secrets.h.example` that contains your WiFi credentials.
