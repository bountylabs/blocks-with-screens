# RGB LED Example

Very simple example that uses the (normally unpopulated) SK6812 LED on the Microcontroller board.

Note, this RGB LED *was not* included in the final assembly of the blocks, so this is only available for reference purposes for those brave enough to solder on their own internal RGB LED to the microcontroller board.
