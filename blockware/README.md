# Blockware

A collection of programs meant to run on the blocks.

## App descriptions

### 90fps

A demo of how to squeeze every last bit of graphics performance out of your block by making better use of the hardware SPI APIs in the microcontroller.

### Accelerometer

The simplest possible accelerometer demo

### Bouncing Logo

The most 90s-est demo we've got. Bounce the Twitter logo around your screen just like your DVD player did to prevent burn-in on your CRT TV in 1999.

### Curvy Snake

It's kinda like those old pipes screensavers, or snake with curves. Watch randomly generated curves snake around your block's screen.

### Gif Download

This demo shows a QR code that takes you to a web page where you can upload a gif, have it translated to a block-friendly format, then the block can download it and begin to display it.

Requires a web component which may or may not be running.

### Homeassistant Display

An example of a program that can connect to a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) home automation interface and display sensor values on the screen.

### JPEG Download Example

An example that downloads a JPEG and displays it on the block.

### Passive Info

An example that downloads stocks and weather.

### Pixel Dust

An example that uses the [Adafruit Pixel Dust](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_PixelDust) to create animated dust that interacts with the accelerometer and a static Twitter Logo.

### RGB Accelerometer

An example that uses the accelerometer and the (optional) internal RGB LED to change the LED's color based on the orientation of the block.

### Snake

The game of snake! This demo creates a WiFi access point that you can connect to on your phone to control the snake.

### Video Display

An example of real-time video streaming to your block.
