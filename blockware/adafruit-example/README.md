# Adafruit Example

A copy/fork of Adafruit's [SSD1351 OLED example code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-SSD1351-library/blob/master/examples/test/test.ino) with the `delay`s removed. Useful as an overview of the available graphics APIs in the Adafruit GFX library. 

## Notes

See also the [README.md in the `90fps` example](https://github.com/bountylabs/blocks-with-screens/blob/main/blockware/90fps/README.md) to learn how to make it run even faster.
